Quick dummy IFD handler to test rdesktop smardcard redirection improvement.

To build just run:

$ make

Copy resulting library to your PCSC serial driver path (e.g. /usr/lib/pcsc/drivers/serial/).
Copy dummyrdr (or merge it with existing configuration file) to your PCSC config location (e.g. /etc/reader.conf.d/)

Start pcscd if it's not started automatically.

You should see "Dummy Reader" as one of the available readers.

Notes:
1) Only T1 is supported (due to chosen historical bytes)
2) There's one special APDU

0x00 0xCA 0x81 0xAA 0xBB that generates 0xAABB bytes with value 0xAA.

So
0x00 0xCA 0x81 0x00 0x02 will generate

0xAA 0xAA 0x90 0x00 as a response


All other APDUs result in 0x9000.
